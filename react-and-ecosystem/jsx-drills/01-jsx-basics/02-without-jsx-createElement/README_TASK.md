# Task: Same View Without JSX


**Goal**: understand that JSX is just sugar over `React.createElement`.


## Instructions
1. Build the same view as the previous exercise using only `React.createElement`.
2. Compare the structure (e.g. in React DevTools) with the JSX version.


## Acceptance Criteria
- The render is identical to 01-h1-element.
- No JSX is used in the file.


## Hints
- `createElement(tag, props, ...children)`.
