# Task: JSX as Function Argument


**Goal**: pass JSX into a function and render its result.


## Instructions
1. Write a function that takes `content` (JSX) and wraps it in extra markup.
2. Use it in multiple places; vary the input JSX.
3. Compare with an equivalent component; discuss trade-offs.


## Acceptance Criteria
- Function works with different JSX fragments and returns valid JSX.
- Pros/cons vs using a component are articulated.
