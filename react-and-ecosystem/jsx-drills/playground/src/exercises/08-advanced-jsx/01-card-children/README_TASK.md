# Task: Component with `props.children`


**Goal**: build `Card` displaying passed children.


## Instructions
1. Implement `<Card>{/* JSX here */}</Card>`.
2. Use it multiple times with different content and optional `title`.
3. Verify that layout is consistent while content varies.


## Acceptance Criteria
- `Card` composes content via `children` and supports an optional title.
- Instances share layout but render different content.
