# Task: Array of Components


**Goal**: store components in an array and render dynamically.


## Instructions
1. Create an array of JSX elements or of factories returning elements.
2. Render the array. If generated dynamically, ensure items have stable `key`s.
3. Demonstrate reordering without breaking layout.


## Acceptance Criteria
- Components render in the configured order.
- Dynamic arrays use stable keys when listed.
