# Task: Using Fragments


**Goal**: use `React.Fragment` or `<>` to return multiple elements.


## Instructions
1. Replace the wrapper element from the previous task with a fragment.
2. Verify the UI is unchanged but the DOM no longer contains the wrapper node.
3. Show both syntaxes: short `<>...</>` and `<React.Fragment>...</React.Fragment>`.
4. In a small list, use keyed fragments when mapping.


## Acceptance Criteria
- Component renders successfully using fragments.
- DOM has no unnecessary wrapper nodes.
- Example includes both fragment syntaxes and a keyed fragment in a `map`.
