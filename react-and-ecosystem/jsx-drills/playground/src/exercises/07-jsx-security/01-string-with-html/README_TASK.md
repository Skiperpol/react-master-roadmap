# Task: Displaying a String Containing HTML


**Goal**: see that JSX does not parse HTML from strings.


## Instructions
1. Render `"<strong>Hello!</strong>"`.
2. Verify the browser displays the angle brackets literally.
3. Explain why this default is safer.


## Acceptance Criteria
- Text displays literally; no HTML is interpreted.
- Rationale for escaping is articulated.
