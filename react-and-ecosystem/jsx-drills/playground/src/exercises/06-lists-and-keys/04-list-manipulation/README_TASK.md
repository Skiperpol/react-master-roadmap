# Task: List Manipulation


**Goal**: test add/remove/sort with proper `key` usage.


## Instructions
1. Ensure each item has a stable `id`.
2. Implement add, remove, and sort operations immutably.
3. Verify that item-specific state (e.g., input values) stays with the item.


## Acceptance Criteria
- UI updates smoothly; state stays attached to items across operations.
