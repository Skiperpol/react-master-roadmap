# Task: List of Objects


**Goal**: render an array of objects (e.g. users) as a list.


## Instructions
1. Map objects to `<li>` showing key fields.
2. First, skip `key` to observe the console warning.
3. Then add `key` using the objectâ€™s stable identifier.


## Acceptance Criteria
- List renders correctly.
- You can reproduce and then eliminate the missing `key` warning.
