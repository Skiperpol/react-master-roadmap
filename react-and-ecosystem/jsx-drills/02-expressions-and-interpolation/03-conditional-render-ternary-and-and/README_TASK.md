# Task: Conditional Render â€” `? :` and `&&`


**Goal**: compare two conditional rendering techniques.


## Instructions
1. Use ternary operator to render two different views.
2. Use `&&` to conditionally add an extra element.
3. Pay attention to falsy values (e.g. `0`).


## Acceptance Criteria
- Both approaches work, and you know when to choose each.
